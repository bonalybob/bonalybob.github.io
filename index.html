          <h2>Munro</h2>
          <p>
            Munro is a sports league results calculator, created for my local
            Orienteering league as part of my Advanced Higher computing project.
            It is a single page web app with offline support made using VueJS,
            with a Python Flask backend powering the restful API and connecting
            to the Postgres database.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built using feedback from Orienteers, it has interactive results
            views - enabling the user to sort and search the results easily,
            whilst making the results upload process as easy and flexible as
            possible, by supporting many different scoring systems and results
            formats, so that the work of volunteers is reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Munro is now used successfully by several orienteering leagues
            across Scotland.

          <h2>Lockdown Orienteering</h2>
          <p>
            I was asked by
            <a class="inline" href="https://lockdownorienteering.wordpress.com/"
              >Lockdown Orienteering</a
            >
            to program two games that they had designed, for one of their
            weekends of online competitions, to challenge navigational abilities
            during the lockdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first game was the Course Choice Game, to practice for the
            Knockout Sprint. It displays an image of 3 maps then the user has to
            select the map showing the shortest route in less than 20s. The
            other game was the Rapid Route Game, where you had to draw the
            shortest route between 2 points on a map as quickly as possible. The
            routes were automatically marked by checking they went through a
            series of points.
          </p>
          <p>
            The games were both created in under a week ready for the
            competition with over 550 competitors using them in a day. A special
            verison of both games were deployed on Firebase, which saved and
            displayed results

          <h2>Nevis</h2>
          <p>
            Nevis is a simple and easy to use event management system built
            using VueJS and ElectronJS with a MySQL database. It reads the raw
            timing chip data through the serial port, then using data imported
            (from several standard file types), Nevis calculates the results for
            an event, ready for export in a variety of formats. Nevis
            automatically matches unknown chips with entries in the chip archive
            and finds the best matching course. It also makes it easy to search
            and sort the entries and view and update all information about the
            event.
